@interviews_start
Feature: The interviews run without erroring

This file:
[x] Test that each interview starts without an error.
[x] Contains some additional example Steps. They use fake values and are commented out with a "#" so they won't run.

These tests are made to work with the ALKiln testing framework, an automated testing framework made under the Document Assembly Line Project.
