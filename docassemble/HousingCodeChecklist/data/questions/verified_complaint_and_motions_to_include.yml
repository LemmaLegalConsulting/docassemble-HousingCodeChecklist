id: File a Verified Complaint Form
question: |
  Get help from a judge in court
subquestion: |
  The next set of forms will help you file a complaint against your landlord in court.
  
  A judge can order your landlord to:
  
  1. Fix problems in your apartment
  1. Let you back in to the apartment if they illegally locked you out
  1. Turn back on utility services or start paying for utility services
  1. Pay you money (damages) based on your rights under Massachusetts law

  The court may charge you up to 
  ${ currency(verified_complaint_tro_fee +verified_complaint_entry_of_action_Fee) } to file
  these documents. But most tenants can file at no cost. We will ask you questions to
  find out if you can file for free later on.

question: |
  Getting help right away
subquestion: |
  If you need help right away, a judge can give you an emergency order.
  The emergency order is supposed to last for 10 days.

  Later, the judge can make the order permanent if the landlord doesn't
  fix the problem right away.

      Is there anything you want to say about why you need an emergency order?
      Your complaint will include the facts of the problems you mentioned. So
      you don't need to repeat that here. 

      Include information about special circumstances that make your situation
      urgent. If you don't have special circumstances, it's okay to leave this
      section blank.

subject: |
  What money can I get?
content: |
  You have a right to ask for money from your landlord because of the problems
  that your landlord did not fix.

  In most cases, the money can either be:

  1. A percentage off of your rent for each month you had the problem, or
  1. A flat 3 times your monthly rent for a **serious** problem.

template: complaint_right_to_get_money_should_i
subject: |
  Should I ask for money from my landlord?
content: |
  Deciding to sue for money can be complicated.

  You may **not** want to ask for money from your landlord in this lawsuit if:

  1. You think your landlord may file an eviction case against you.
  1. You think you may be able to hire a lawyer later.

  If your landlord files an eviction case against you, you may want to "save" your claim
  for money as part of the eviction case. Your claim may be able to stop the eviction if
  the eviction is for "no fault" or for not paying rent.

  [Read the article about defenses on the MassLegalHelp website](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-legal-defenses-counterclaims-article).

  But if your landlord evicts you for a "fault" reason (something other than being behind
  in the rent), you cannot use your other claims to stop the eviction. You may be better 
  off asking for money in this lawsuit.

  If you are not sure, you may want to try to [find a lawyer using the Mass Legal Resource Finder](https://masslrf.org/en/triage/start/housing).

#  Massachusetts has special protections for tenants when their landlord is a business.
#  The protections might mean that your landlord has to pay for your attorney if they lose. They
#  also can double or triple the amount of money you can win in a lawsuit.
#  
#  These questions help a judge decide if your landlord is a business or someone just renting an 
#  apartment in their home to reduce their own housing cost.

  The court may charge you a fee to file these forms.
