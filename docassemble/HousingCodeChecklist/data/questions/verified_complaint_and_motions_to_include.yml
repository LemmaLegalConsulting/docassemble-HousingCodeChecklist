  You may **not** want to ask for money from your landlord in this lawsuit if:
  
  1. You think your landlord may file an eviction case against you.

  If your landlord files an eviction case against you, you may want to "save" your claim
  for money as part of the eviction case. Your claim may be able to stop the eviction if
  the eviction is for "no fault" or for not paying rent.

  [Read the article about defenses on the MassLegalHelp website](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing-apartments-shelter/eviction/legal-defenses-and-counterclaims).

  in the rent), you cannot use your other claims to stop the eviction. You may be better 
  off asking for money in this lawsuit.

#  Massachusetts has special protections for tenants when their landlord is a business.

#  also can double or triple the amount of money you can win in a lawsuit.
#  
#  These questions help a judge decide if your landlord is a business or someone just renting an 
#  apartment in their home to reduce their own housing cost.
