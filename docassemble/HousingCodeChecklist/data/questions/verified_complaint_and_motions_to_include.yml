  The next set of forms will help you file a complaint against your landlord in court.
  
  A judge can order your landlord to:
  
  1. Fix problems in your apartment
  1. Let you back in to the apartment if they illegally locked you out
  1. Turn back on utility services or start paying for utility services
  1. Pay you money (damages) based on your rights under Massachusetts law

  The court may charge you up to 
  ${ currency(verified_complaint_tro_fee +verified_complaint_entry_of_action_Fee) } to file
  these documents. But most tenants can file at no cost. We will ask you questions to
  find out if you can file for free later on.

  You may **not** want to ask for money from your landlord in this lawsuit if:
  
  1. You think your landlord may file an eviction case against you.

  If your landlord files an eviction case against you, you may want to "save" your claim
  for money as part of the eviction case. Your claim may be able to stop the eviction if
  the eviction is for "no fault" or for not paying rent.

  [Read the article about defenses on the MassLegalHelp website](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-legal-defenses-counterclaims-article).

  But if your landlord evicts you for a "fault" reason (something other than being behind
  in the rent), you cannot use your other claims to stop the eviction. You may be better 
  off asking for money in this lawsuit.

  If you are not sure, you may want to try to [find a lawyer using the Mass Legal Resource Finder](https://masslrf.org/en/triage/start/housing).

#  Massachusetts has special protections for tenants when their landlord is a business.
#  The protections might mean that your landlord has to pay for your attorney if they lose. They
#  also can double or triple the amount of money you can win in a lawsuit.
#  
#  These questions help a judge decide if your landlord is a business or someone just renting an 
#  apartment in their home to reduce their own housing cost.

  You said you did not send a demand letter yet
subquestion: |
  Most tenants send their landlord a demand letter
  before they sue their landlord for money.

  Sending your landlord a demand letter means:

  - Your landlord may need to pay for your attorney if you win
  - You may get up to 3 times the total amount of money
fields:
  - What do you want to do?: confirm_ask_for_damages
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Ask only for emergency repairs now. I will sue my landlord for money later, after I send a demand letter: postpone_damages
      - Ask for both repairs and money now. I understand I may get less total money.: keep_on_suing
  - note: |
      **Okay**. After you finish this complaint, we will help you complete a
      demand letter. We can also remind you to come back and ask for money in
      about 30 days.
    show if:
      variable: confirm_ask_for_damages
      is: postpone_damages
  - note: |
      **Okay**. Your complaint will include a demand that your landlord must respond to within 30 days. We can remind you to come back and amend your complaint after 30 days.
