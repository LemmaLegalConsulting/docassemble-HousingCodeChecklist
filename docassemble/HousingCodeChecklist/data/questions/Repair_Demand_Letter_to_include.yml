question: |
  Repair Demand Letter
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you write a letter to your landlord asking them to pay you 
  because they did not fix a problem in your home, such as:
  
  - lack of heat,
  - mice or insects, 
  - or any other bad housing condition that is your landlord's responsibility.
  
  Your landlord has 30 days to answer your letter with an amount that is fair.

  ${ collapse_template(help_93a_damages_explanation) }

  At the end of this interview you will get a letter that you need to deliver to your
  landlord.

subject: |
  What happens if my landlord ignores me?
content: |
  If your landlord: 
  
  - does not answer the letter, or
  - answers but does not offer to pay you a fair amount
  
  Then a court may decide that you have a right to be paid triple damages.
  Triple damages means that a judge or jury calculates the amount that the law says 
  would repay you for the harm caused by your landlord. 
  Then they multiply it by 3. For example:
  
  If | then the amount you would get is
  ---|-----------------------------------
  The jury decides that $500 would repay you | $1,500 instead

subquestion: |
  Based on your answers, your landlord is **not** a business.

  You cannot sue them or ask for money using the
  [Consumer Protection Law
  (M.G.L. c. 93A)](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/the-massachusetts-consumer-protection-law).

  You cannot ask for treble damages.

  What amount can I ask for?
content: |
  Most tenants can ask for:

  1. Three times the amount of their rent for a very serious problem, or
  1. A fair percentage off of their rent for each month that they had the problems.

  Pick the number that is higher. You cannot get both.
    
  For example, if you had a problem for a whole month and your rent was $2,000/month, and:
  
  If | And a fair percentage to take off of the rent was | Then the amount you can ask for would be
  ---|---------------------------|-----------------------------------
  You had a minor problem with mice | 10% | $200
  You had no heat during a mild part of the winter | 50% | $1000
  You could not lock your doors | 25% | $500

  The amount that is a fair percentage to ask for depends on the facts of your
  case. It is up to a judge or jury to decide what amount is fair.
