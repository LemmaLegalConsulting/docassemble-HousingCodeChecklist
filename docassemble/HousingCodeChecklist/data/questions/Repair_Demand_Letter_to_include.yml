question: |
  Repair Demand Letter
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you write a letter to your landlord asking them to pay you 
  because they did not fix a problem in your home, such as:
  
  - lack of heat,
  - mice or insects, 
  - or any other bad housing condition that is your landlord's responsibility.
  
  Your landlord has 30 days to answer your letter with an amount that is fair.

  ${ collapse_template(help_93a_damages_explanation) }

  At the end of this interview you will get a letter that you need to deliver to your
  landlord.

  What happens if my landlord ignores me?
content: |
  If your landlord: 
  
  - does not answer the letter, or
  - answers but does not offer to pay you a fair amount
  
  Then a court may decide that you have a right to be paid triple damages.
  Triple damages means that a judge or jury calculates the amount that the law says 
  would repay you for the harm caused by your landlord. 
  Then they multiply it by 3. For example:
  
  If | then the amount you would get is
  ---|-----------------------------------
  The jury decides that $500 would repay you | $1,500 instead

  Most tenants can ask for:

  1. Three times the amount of their rent for a very serious problem, or
  1. A fair percentage off of their rent for each month that they had the problems.

  Pick the number that is higher. You cannot get both.
