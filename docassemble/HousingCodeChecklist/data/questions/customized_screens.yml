  Document the problem
content: |
  Keeping good records is important. Before you can get a problem fixed,
  you need to be able to tell your landlord and the court where the problem
  is.
  
  You can use this website to record problems and upload pictures.
  
  You could also:
  
  * Use your phone or a camera to take pictures of the problems.
  * Use a thermometer or a photo of your thermostat and write down the
    time and date of each recording.
  
  The best records come from a housing inspector. See the information below
  about calling an inspector.

  Notify your landlord

  Your landlord is only responsible to fix problems that they know about.
  Make sure your landlord knows about problems in your house by telling them,
  even if you think that they should already know.
  
  Use a way to tell your landlord that you can track and prove.
  
  * Write your landlord a text message.
  * Write a letter on paper, and keep a copy for yourself. Make sure the date
    is on the letter.
  * Write an email.
  
  You can use this website to tell your landlord about the problems in your
  home.

template: get_inspection_template
subject: |
  Call a housing inspector
content: |
  A housing inspector is someone who works for the city or the housing 
  authority.
  
  If you live in public housing or have a Section 8 voucher, the Housing
  Authority will inspect your home at least once a year. But you can call if 
  you need them to come sooner.
  
  All tenants, including tenants who live in public housing, can call a city
  inspector. The city inspector should come within 1 day to inspect emergency
  problems.
  
  In Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, and Worcester you can call the Inspectional
  Services Division.
  
  In other cities and towns, call the Board of Health.
  
  Before calling the inspector, use this website to create and print a list of 
  the problems that you have identified. This will help make sure that the
  inspector does not miss any problems.

  1. Ask a judge to enforce an order from a housing inspector.
  1. Get a temporary restraining order.

template: how_to_defend_eviction_template
subject: |
  Stop your eviction
content: |
  Sometimes a landlord will file an eviction case against a tenant if they
  complain about problems in their house.
  
  This is illegal. In Massachusetts, evicting a tenant because they complained
  about bad housing conditions or other housing problems is called
  "retaliation". [Law about retaliation](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-illegal-eviction).
  
  Even if your landlord is not evicting you **because** you complained about
  problems in your house, the problems may be a defense to your eviction.
  [239 &sect; 
  8A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIII/Chapter239/Section8A) 
  makes bad housing conditions a defense to an eviction if:
  
  1. The eviction is for nonpayment of rent or for no reason.
  1. The problems threaten the health and safety of someone who lives in the
    apartment.
  1. The landlord knew about the problems at a time that the tenant did not
  owe any rent.
  1. The problems were not caused by the tenant.
  1. The problems can be fixed without the tenant moving out permanently.
  
  You can defend against your eviction with MADE, Massachusetts Defense
  Against Eviction.

template: sue_your_landlord_template
subject: |
  Sue your landlord for money
content: |
  You have a right to sue your landlord for money if you have problems in
  your home that your landlord is responsible to fix.
  
  You may be able to sue as part of an existing eviction case. Or you can
  file your own case against your landlord.
  
  It is a good idea to [talk to a lawyer](https://masslrf.org/en/triage/start/housing). You may be able to get a lawyer who will help you for free.
  
  You can sue for:
  
  * Breach of Quiet Enjoyment, which may entitle you to up to 3 months of rent,
    at the market rent for your apartment.
  * Breach of the Warranty of Habitability, which may entitle you to a
    percentage of your rent for every month that the problem existed.

  A breach of quiet enjoyment is something that your landlord did or should
  have done that makes your home unlivable. This can cover a lot of different
  issues. The problem needs to be serious and you can get help for issues
  that the court agrees are emergencies with this form.
  
  Examples might include:
  
  * A sewage backup in your basement
  * A strong unpleasant odor
  * Constant noise at unreasonable times of day (remember, even if you are
  working from home, permitted construction may still be allowed)
  * Unsafe living conditions that your landlord isn't fixing

  * Boston Municipal Court (BMC)
  * Superior Court

  Most tenants choose the Housing Court. If your Housing Court is
  far away or hard to get to, you may decide to file in the District
  Court or Boston Municipal Court.

  Unless you have talked to an attorney and have a special reason, you should
  not file in the Superior Court.
  
  The District Court, BMC, and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
  any type of case. Housing Court is a
    **specialist** court that hears only housing cases.
  They have judges with special training as well as special 
  resources available.
    
  Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
  your address. There are about 100 district courts all over the state,
  but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
  courts.
  
  Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
  as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
  
  Only you know the right choice.
