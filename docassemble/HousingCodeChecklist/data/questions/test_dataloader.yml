question: |
  You have the right to a safe and decent home
subquestion: |  
  A bad housing condition is something in your home that needs to be fixed,
  like a leaky faucet or not having heat in the winter. Some are little and
  some are big. But everyone has a right to a safe home--**without** any
  bad housing conditions.
    
  #### :hand-paper: If you are being evicted
  
  You can use another free tool, [MADE](https://interviews.gbls.org/start/eviction),
  to fight your eviction in court. It will take about 30-45 minutes. 
continue button field: intro
---
question: |
  ${ users.familiar() }, you can do this!
subquestion: |  
  This tool will help you solve problems with bad conditions in your home.
  
  First, learn about what your landlord's responsibilities are. Next,
  track the problems that you have in your home. You can also add information
  about when the problem started and upload photographs.
  
  Finally, decide what you want to do about it. You can:
  
  * Let your landlord know about the problem.
  * Call a housing inspector.
  * Withhold rent.
  * Ask a judge to order your landlord to fix the problems.
  * Sue your landlord in court for money.

template: how_to_document_template
subject: |
  Document the problem
content: |
  Keeping good records is important. Before you can get a problem fixed,
  you need to be able to tell your landlord and the court where the problem
  is.
  
  Use the tools that you have to take your records. You can use this website
  to record problems and upload pictures.
  
  You could also:
  
  * Use your phone or a camera to take pictures of the problems.
  * Use a thermometer or a photo of your thermostat and write down the
    time and date of each recording.
  
  The best records come from a housing inspector. See the information below
  about calling an inspector.
---
template: how_to_notify_landlord_template
subject: |
  Notify your landlord
content: |
  Your landlord is only responsible to fix problems that they know about.
  Make sure your landlord knows about problems in your house by telling them,
  even if you think that they should already know.
  
  Use a way to tell your landlord that you can track and prove.
  
  * Write your landlord a text message.
  * Write a letter on paper, and keep a copy for yourself. Make sure the date
    is on the letter.
  * Write an email.
  
  You can use this website to tell your landlord about the problems in your
  home.

template: get_inspection_template
subject: |
  Call a housing inspector
content: |
  A housing inspector is someone who works for the city or the housing 
  authority.
  
  If you live in public housing or have a Section 8 voucher, the Housing
  Authority will inspect your home at least once a year. But you can call if 
  you need them to come sooner.
  
  All tenants, including tenants who live in public housing, can call a city
  inspector. The city inspector should come within 1 day to inspect emergency
  problems.
  
  In Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, and Worcester you can call the Inspectional
  Services Division.
  
  In other cities and towns, call the Board of Health.
  
  Before calling the inspector, use this website to create and print a list of 
  the problems that you have identified. This will help make sure that the
  inspector does not miss any problems.

template: get_injunction_template
subject: |
  Get emergency help from a judge
content: |
  You can get emergency help from a judge in two different ways:
  
  1. Ask a judge to enforce an order from a housing inspector.
  1. Get a temporary restraining order.

template: how_to_defend_eviction_template
subject: |
  Stop your eviction
content: |
  Sometimes a landlord will file an eviction case against a tenant if they
  complain about problems in their house.
  
  This is illegal. In Massachusetts, evicting a tenant because they complained
  about bad housing conditions or other housing problems is called
  "retaliation". [Law about retaliation](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-illegal-eviction).
  
  Even if your landlord is not evicting you **because** you complained about
  problems in your house, the problems may be a defense to your eviction.
  [239 &sect; 
  8A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIII/Chapter239/Section8A) 
  makes bad housing conditions a defense to an eviction if:
  
  1. The eviction is for nonpayment of rent or for no reason.
  1. The problems threaten the health and safety of someone who lives in the
    apartment.
  1. The landlord knew about the problems at a time that the tenant did not
  owe any rent.
  1. The problems were not caused by the tenant.
  1. The problems can be fixed without the tenant moving out permanently.
  
  You can defend against your eviction with MADE, Massachusetts Defense
  Against Eviction.

template: sue_your_landlord_template
subject: |
  Sue your landlord for money
content: |
  You have a right to sue your landlord for money if you have problems in
  your home that your landlord is responsible to fix.
  
  You may be able to sue as part of an existing eviction case. Or you can
  file your own case against your landlord.
  
  It is a good idea to [talk to a lawyer](https://masslrf.org/en/triage/start/housing). You may be able to get a lawyer who will help you for free.
  
  You can sue for:
  
  * Breach of Quiet Enjoyment, which may entitle you to up to 3 months of rent,
    at the market rent for your apartment.
  * Breach of the Warranty of Habitability, which may entitle you to a
    percentage of your rent for every month that the problem existed.
